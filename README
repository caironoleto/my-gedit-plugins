File Search Plugin for Gedit
=============================
This is a search plugin for Gedit to search for a text inside a directory. It is still far from being complete - it should basically work, but many features are still missing.

The plugin should work with Gedit 2.16 and higher (that would be for example Ubuntu Edgy, or Debian Etch, or RedHat Enterprise Linux 5).
